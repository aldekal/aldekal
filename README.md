**Welcome to My GitHub Profile!**

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. Allow me to introduce myself and share a little about what I do.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Stuttgart, and I'm on the cusp of completing my studies. As of now, I'm fully engrossed in crafting my Bachelor's thesis, which is an exciting and challenging journey.

## Interests

### Application Systems Architecture

One of my primary areas of interest is the architecture of application systems. I am captivated by the process of designing and building robust, scalable, and efficient software solutions. I enjoy delving into the intricacies of system components, exploring different architectural patterns, and applying best practices to create reliable and maintainable applications.

### Quantum Computing

In addition to application systems architecture, I have a deep fascination for the cutting-edge field of quantum computing. The realm of quantum mechanics and its potential to revolutionize computational paradigms intrigues me. I am eager to explore the quantum realm, understand quantum algorithms, and contribute to the advancements in this groundbreaking technology.
